# _@agent\_z_/**egg**
To install egg, Simply run `npm i -g @agent_z/egg`. Want to use another package manager? Well too bad!

## List of compatible package managers
- npm
- pnpm
- bun

## Why Yarn doesn't work
Egg uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as its main runtime to cut slack and run the typescript directly and efficiently. So, Bun is naturally included in its dependencies. However, Yarn does not allow linking binaries, So yarn will throw an error and die during the installation process. Any other package manager is fine though!

## Recommendations
I recommend you install bun from the official website before installing Egg, As I have not tested wether the bun dependency works well on devices without bun installed or not.

## Syntax guide
Coming soon!
