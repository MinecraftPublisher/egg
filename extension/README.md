# Egg Language Support
This extension provides the following:
- Syntax higlighting for `.egg` files
- Hover information about commands and examples
- Basic error checking*

**\***: The error checking does not implement a dry run, Therefore it does not pre-evaluate math expressions, Follow stacks, Error check eval calls, etc.
